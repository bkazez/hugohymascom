      <h1>Engineering</h1>

      <p>In addition to singing, I am also a classical recording engineer and video maker. I studied with Philipp Reif, Tonmeister for the Berlin Philharmonic, and I have recorded everything from albums to digital content for early music ensembles.</p>

      <p>I strive to capture not just the excitement of a great performance, but the excitement of being <em>part</em> of a great performance â€“ from the warmth of the room to the finest details of musical expression.</p>

      <p>As an engineer and producer, I work with you to understand your goals and then design the best audio and video setup to capture you and the music. As a musician myself, I enjoy creating a relaxed, safe atmosphere where everyone can take the biggest risks and do their best work.</p>

      <p>In postproduction, I mix audio, help select audio takes (and camera angles, for video), and use these to produce a finished product that is as musical as possible.</p>

      <p>My equipment and recording technique are highly transparent, so the result sounds as good as you sound in real life: 8 Schoeps mics, RME preamps and conversion, and 2 4K Sony video cameras.</p>
